# Refactoring Plan for `spell_card_generator`

## Goals
- Improve code quality, readability, and maintainability
- Ensure compliance with flake8, black, and pylint
- Organize code structure and naming
- Remove dead code and unused imports
- Add/Improve docstrings and type hints
- Ensure all code passes linting and formatting checks

## Steps

1. **Initial Code Audit**
   - Review all Python files for structure, style, and common issues
   - Identify areas needing refactoring (complex functions, duplicate code, etc.)

2. **Linting and Formatting Baseline**
   - Run flake8, black, and pylint on all files
   - Document existing issues and violations

3. **Configure Pylint Settings**
   - Generate default pylint configuration file
   - Adjust overly strict limits (max-attributes, max-locals, max-arguments, etc.)
   - Configure reasonable thresholds for project complexity
   - Re-run pylint with custom configuration to get realistic baseline
   - Document justified rule adjustments

4. **Refactor Imports and Module Structure**
   - Fix main.py to use absolute imports (remove sys.path manipulation)
   - Add entry point to pyproject.toml for proper package execution
   - Remove unused imports
   - Organize imports (group standard, third-party, local)
   - Ensure all modules have proper `__init__.py` files
   - Update README.md with proper development workflow documentation

5. **Code Style and Formatting**
   - Apply black formatting to all files
   - Fix flake8 and pylint issues (line length, naming, whitespace, etc.)

6. **Function and Class Refactoring**
   - Split large functions/classes into smaller, focused units
   - Priority: `app.py` SpellCardGeneratorApp class (break into smaller components)
   - Priority: `latex_generator.py` generate_cards method (extract helper methods)
   - Add/Improve docstrings and type hints consistently
   - Consider using Enums for constants where appropriate
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions
   - Improve pathlib usage throughout for better path handling

7. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Standardize exception handling
   - Add logging where appropriate

8. **Character Class Selection Refactor**
   - Replace grid of checkboxes with a treeview (or single-selection listbox) for character class selection.
   - Enforce single selection: selecting a class automatically deselects any previous selection.
   - On app start, present only the character class selection UI.
   - After selection, proceed to spell filtering/generation for the chosen class.
   - Update UI logic and documentation to reflect new workflow.

9. **Sidebar Multi-Step Workflow for Spell Card Generation**
   - Implement a sidebar navigation in the main window, with tabs for each step:
     - Spell Selection
     - Overwrite Options
     - Documentation URLs
     - Secondary Language QR Links
     - Preview/Generate
   - Allow users to freely switch between tabs at any time.
   - If a user tries to access later tabs without selecting spells, show a clear message and provide a button/link to return to Spell Selection.
   - **Central in-memory state**: All user input is stored in a central state object, including data for de-selected spells. If a spell is re-selected, previously entered data is restored. (State is not persisted between app runs.)
   - When spell selection changes, update dependent data (remove data for deselected spells, add defaults for new ones, but retain previous data for re-selected spells).
   - Provide visual feedback for valid/invalid URLs and other inputs.
   - Allow users to skip optional steps (e.g., secondary language).
   - Always show a summary/preview before final generation.
   - Auto-save user input on each tab; switching tabs never loses data.
   - Option to reset a step to defaults if needed.
   - Tooltips or help icons for complex fields (e.g., URL validation).
   - Keyboard navigation and accessibility support.
   - Final tab shows a summary of all choices before generation.

10. **Testing and Validation**
   - Ensure all existing tests pass
   - Add/Update tests for refactored code
   - Run linting and formatting tools to confirm compliance
   - Add typechecking with mypy

11. **Code Coverage and Testing Setup**
   - Add pytest and coverage.py to pyproject.toml dependencies  
   - Create tests/ directory structure
   - Set up pytest configuration and coverage settings
   - Priority test areas: data loading, spell filtering, LaTeX generation
   - Create mock data for testing UI components
   - Measure code coverage and document results
   - Identify and prioritize untested code for new tests

12. **Configuration and Dependency Management**
   - Review and update pyproject.toml (add missing dev dependencies)
   - Add entry point configuration for proper package execution
   - Consider moving some string constants to Enums
   - Standardize configuration loading patterns
   - Review requirements.txt vs pyproject.toml consistency

13. **Documentation Update**
   - Update README and code comments as needed
   - Document any major changes in agent-plan.md
   - Add inline documentation for complex algorithms
   - Create developer setup guide additions if needed

## Tool Usage
- Use Poetry environment at `spell_card_generator/.venv` for all python commands
- Add new tools with `poetry -C spell_card_generator add <package>`

## Step 1: Initial Code Audit - COMPLETED

### Key Findings:

**Structure Issues:**
- Import issues in `main.py` - using relative import `from app import` instead of absolute
- Manual sys.path manipulation in `main.py` - anti-pattern
- Missing type hints consistently across files
- Long functions in `app.py` and `latex_generator.py` need refactoring

**Code Quality Issues:**
- Mixed import styles (some absolute, some relative)
- Inconsistent docstring formats
- Long line lengths likely exceed 88 characters (Black standard)
- Complex functions like `generate_cards()` and `_setup_options_ui()` need splitting
- Magic numbers and strings scattered throughout code

**Positive Aspects:**
- Good separation of concerns with clear module structure
- Proper use of dataclasses in `models/spell.py`
- Custom exception hierarchy is well-designed
- Configuration centralized in `constants.py`

**Areas Needing Refactoring:**
1. `app.py` - Large class with multiple responsibilities (150+ lines)
2. `latex_generator.py` - Complex generation logic, long methods
3. `main.py` - Import and path issues 
4. UI modules - Long methods, mixed concerns
5. Missing comprehensive error handling
6. No logging implementation
7. No test framework detected

**Additional Findings:**
- `pyproject.toml` exists but may need entry point configuration
- Good use of dataclasses but missing from_dict/to_dict methods
- Type hints partially present but inconsistent
- Constants class structure is good but could use Enums for some values
- File path handling could be more robust with pathlib throughout

## Step 2: Linting and Formatting Baseline - COMPLETED

### Linting Results Summary:

**Black Formatting: ✅ PASSED**
- All 20 Python files are already properly formatted
- No formatting changes needed

**Flake8: ✅ PASSED**

   - All modules using relative imports (`from config.constants`, `from ui.main_window`, etc.)
   - This confirms our main.py import structure issue

**Code Quality Issues:**
2. **Too Many Instance Attributes (R0902)**
   - `app.py`: SpellCardGeneratorApp class (15/7 attributes)
   - `models/spell.py`: Spell class (19/7 attributes) 
   - `ui/main_window.py`: MainWindow class (8/7 attributes)

3. **Complex Functions**
   - `generators/latex_generator.py`: generate_cards method (16/15 local variables)
   - `ui/class_selection.py`: Multiple methods with too many locals (18/15)

4. **Exception Handling Issues (W0707)**
   - Missing `from e` in exception re-raising across multiple files
   - Found in: data/filter.py, data/loader.py, generators/latex_generator.py

5. **Code Duplication (R0801)**
   - Duplicate code between data/loader.py and ui/class_selection.py
   - Category processing logic repeated

- **Created `ui/workflow_steps/overwrite_cards_step.py`** - Full overwrite management UI
- **List existing cards** - show spell names, file paths, modification dates, and secondary language detection
- **Per-spell overwrite control** - individual checkboxes for each conflicting spell
- **Bulk actions** - "Select All", "Select None", "Invert Selection" buttons
- **File preview** - popup dialog to preview existing card content before deciding to overwrite
- **Skip vs Overwrite** - clear distinction between skipping generation and replacing files

**✅ Secondary Language Preservation:**
- **Intelligent analysis** - detect existing German URLs, QR codes, and language configuration
- **Preservation checkbox** - "Preserve existing secondary language configuration"
- **Visual indicators** - tree view shows which cards have secondary language content
- **Smart conflict summary** - displays statistics about conflicts and language content

**✅ Workflow Integration:**
- **Dynamic sidebar** - overwrite step only appears when conflicts detected
- **Smart navigation** - proper step transitions based on conflict state
- **State management** - track overwrite decisions and preservation settings in workflow_state
- **Navigation logic** - updated Previous/Next button behavior for conditional step

### Technical Implementation Details:

**File Detection System:**
- **Created `utils/file_scanner.py`** - Comprehensive filesystem scanning utility
- **Method: `detect_existing_cards()`** - Scans for existing .tex files matching selected spells
- **Method: `analyze_existing_card()`** - Analyzes file content for secondary language detection
- **Integration with `LatexGenerator._get_output_file_path()`** - Ensures path consistency

**Overwrite Management Step:**
- **Created `ui/workflow_steps/overwrite_cards_step.py`** - Full-featured overwrite management UI
- **TreeView interface** - Shows conflicting spells with checkboxes, file info, and German content detection
- **File preview functionality** - Popup dialogs to preview existing card content
- **Bulk operations** - Select All, Select None, Invert Selection buttons
- **Summary statistics** - Shows total conflicts, files with German content, total size

**Workflow State Extensions:**
- **Added `overwrite_decisions: Dict[str, bool]`** - Per-spell overwrite decisions
- **Added `preserve_secondary_language: bool`** - Global preservation setting
- **Added `existing_cards: Dict[str, Path]`** - Cache of detected existing files
- **Added `conflicts_detected: bool`** - Flag for conditional step visibility
- **Method: `get_next_step_after_spells()`** - Smart navigation logic

**Navigation Logic Updates:**
- **Updated `WorkflowCoordinator`** - Includes conflict detection and conditional step creation
- **Updated `ModernSidebar`** - Dynamic step visibility based on conflict state
- **Updated `BaseWorkflowStep`** - Smart navigation that skips overwrite step when no conflicts
- **Step transitions:** Spell Selection → (Overwrite if conflicts) → Generation Options

### User Experience Flow:

1. **User selects spells** in Step 1 (Spell Selection)
2. **System scans** for existing .tex files matching selected spells
3. **If no conflicts:** Navigation goes directly to Step 3 (Documentation URLs)
4. **If conflicts exist:** Step 2 (Overwrite Cards) becomes available and required
5. **User reviews conflicts** and decides per-spell overwrite vs skip actions
6. **User chooses** whether to preserve secondary language configuration
7. **Navigation proceeds** to Step 3 with proper state management

### Advanced Features:

**File Analysis:**
- Parse existing .tex files to detect secondary language QR codes or URLs
- Show preview of existing card content in popup dialog
- Display file modification dates to help user decide on overwrites

**Batch Operations:**
- "Overwrite All" / "Skip All" buttons for bulk decisions
- Filter options: "Show only recently modified", "Show only with secondary language"
- Search/filter through conflicting spells list

**Smart Defaults:**
- If user previously made overwrite decisions, remember preferences
- Automatically skip files that haven't been modified recently
- Suggest preserving secondary language if detected in existing files

### Phase 6 Complete - Enhanced Workflow Features:
1. ✅ **Intelligent conflict detection** with filesystem scanning
2. ✅ **Granular overwrite control** per spell with bulk operations
3. ✅ **Secondary language preservation** option
4. ✅ **Conditional step visibility** - skip when no conflicts
5. ✅ **File preview and analysis** for informed user decisions
6. ✅ **Smart navigation flow** with dynamic step transitions

### Phase 7 - Final Implementation:
- Complete consolidated Documentation & Language URLs step (per-spell English and secondary language URL inputs)
- Complete Preview & Generate step (comprehensive summary and generation)
- Add URL validation and advanced input feedback for both URL types
- Polish animations and transitions
- Integration testing with overwrite functionality
