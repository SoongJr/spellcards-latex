  % LaTeX-formatted description of the spell, generated from the HTML-formatted description_formatted column:
  This spell instantly transports you to a designated des\-ti\-na\-tion, which
  may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Inter\-planar travel is
  not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight
  doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional
  willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its
  maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large
  creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four
  Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be
  in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be
  in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and
  the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell
  resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by
  another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.

  You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the
  destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the
  teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make
  teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

  To see how well the teleportation works, roll d\% and consult the table
  at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for
  definitions of the terms on the table.

  \emph{Familiarity:} ``Very familiar'' is a place where you have been very
  often and where you feel at home. ``Studied carefully'' is a place you
  know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've
  been there often. ``Seen casually'' is a place that you have seen more
  than once but with which you are not very familiar. ``Viewed once'' is a
  place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as
  \emph{scrying.}

  ``False destination'' is a place that does not truly exist or if you are
  teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as
  such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to
  you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain
  results on the table, rather than rolling d\%, since there is no real
  destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.

  \emph{On Target}: You appear where you want to be.

  \emph{Off Target}: You appear safely a random distance away from the
  destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d\% of the
  distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined
  randomly.

  \emph{Similar Area}: You wind up in an area that's visually or
  thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the
  closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the
  spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.

  \emph{Mishap:} You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten
  ``scrambled''. You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the
  chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.

  Each time ``Mishap'' comes up, the characters take more damage and must
  reroll.
