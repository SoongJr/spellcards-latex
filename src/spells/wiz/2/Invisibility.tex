  % LaTeX-formatted description of the spell, generated from the HTML-formatted description_formatted column:
  The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a
  creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on
  someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless
  you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.

  Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items
  picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the
  creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of
  light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible
  source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends
  more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.

  Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other
  conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in
  water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary
  invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is
  reduced to +20 if the creature is moving.

  The spell ends if the subject
  attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any
  spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly
  who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions
  directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm
  indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors,
  talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the
  ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely
  trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth.
  If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible
  along with all its gear.

  Spells such as \emph{bless} that specifically affect allies but not foes
  are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their
  area.

  \emph{Invisibility} can be made permanent (on objects only) with a
  \emph{permanency} spell.
