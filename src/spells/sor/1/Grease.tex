  % SPELL DESCRIPTION BEGIN
  A \emph{grease} spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease.
  Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall.
  A creature can walk within or through the area of \emph{grease}
  at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check.
  Failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details),
  failure by less than 5 means allows the creature to make a Reflex save to prevent a fall
  (it cannot move this round regardless).
  Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.

  The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.

  Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell,
  while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer
  to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect.
  If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item.
  A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts
  to pick up or use the \emph{grease}d item.
  A creature wearing \emph{grease}d armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus
  on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple,
  and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.
