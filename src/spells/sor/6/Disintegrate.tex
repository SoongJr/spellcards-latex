  % print the tabular information at the top of the card:
  \spellcardinfo{}
  % LaTeX-formatted description of the spell, generated from the HTML-formatted description_formatted column:
  A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a
  successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray
  takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any
  creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely
  disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated
  creature's equipment is unaffected.

  When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a
  10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only
  part of any very large object or structure targeted.

  The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as
  \emph{forceful hand} or a \emph{wall of force}, but not magical effects
  such as a \emph{globe of invulnerability} or an \emph{antimagic field}.

  A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially
  affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the
  creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely
  disintegrated.

  Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the
  ray affects only one target per casting.
