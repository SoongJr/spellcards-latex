	A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	
	\textbf{Effects:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Deals fire damage to all creatures in the area.
		\item Ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
		\item A successful save halves the damage taken.
	\end{enumerate}
