% this file contains templates to show spell cards.
% They are be used by convert.sh to create spell cards from the Spell-DB,
% but the user is encouraged to modify those files to best suit their needs
% (fit spells on the cards nicely, rephrase ambigious descriptions,
% include information from other spells for those "works like X" spells, etc.)

  % TODO: I would really love to have markers along the right-hand side of the page
  % whose vertical position tells you at a glance the level of the spell,
  % like some books mark their chapters, so you can quickly flip through a stack of cards
  % to get to the the level you are looking for.
  % No ordinary printer will be capable of actually printing these to the edge,
  % but maybe we can get pretty close and dedicated users can finish it by hand.
  % Currently I envision printing the spell level as close as possible to the edge
  % and providing a 3D-printable jig or template to stick the card into
  % and then color over it with a marker to the edge.
