% this file contains templates to show spell cards.

% function for drawing the spell marker
% draw a marker on the right side of the page to quickly flip through the cards
% and find the spell level you are looking for.
% When cardified, this edge will be at the center of a DIN A4 page,
% so there is no problem printing "all the way to the edge".
% The intention is for the user to color the marker with a highlighter after cutting the pages free.
