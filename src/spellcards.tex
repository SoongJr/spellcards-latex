  a4paper,
  twoside,      % one side is the front, the other the back of cards. With \cleardoublepage we can ensure a spell starts on the front of a new card.
  DIV=14,       % reduce margins to account for the reduced space on the smaller cards
  fontsize=12pt,% increase font size to make the text more readable when scaled down to four cards per A4 page
  BCOR=0mm,     % no binding correction necessary
  draft=true,   % helps to point out overfull boxes etc.

% include actual spell cards, these class-specific files contain the actual spells to include in the PDF, usually the ones for a character's current level-up.
% It is rare that all spells are needed at once, but if you do wish to do that, here's the command to run:
%   class=sor bash -c 'cd src && find "spells/${class}" -name "*.tex" | sed "s/\.tex$//" | xargs -I{} printf "\input{%s}\n" {} > "spells/${class}.tex"'
\input{spells/sor}

% print a look-up card with all spell-level markers user can then apply their chosen color scheme to
% (once you've printed this, you are expected to comment this line)
