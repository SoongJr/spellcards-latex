% include actual spell cards, these class-specific files contain the actual spells to include in the PDF, usually the ones for a character's current level-up.
% It is rare that all spells are needed at once, but if you do wish to do that, here's the command to run:
%   class=sor bash -c 'cd src && find "spells/${class}" -name "*.tex" | sed "s/\.tex$//" | xargs -I{} printf "\\includespell{%s.tex}\n" {} > "spells/${class}.tex"'
\input{spells/sor}
