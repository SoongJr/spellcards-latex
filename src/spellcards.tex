  a4paper,
  twoside,      % one side is the front, the other the back of cards. With \cleardoublepage we can ensure a spell starts on the front of a new card.
  DIV=14,       % reduce margins to account for the reduced space on the smaller cards
  fontsize=12pt,% increase font size to make the text more readable when scaled down to four cards per A4 page
  BCOR=0mm,     % no binding correction necessary
  draft=true,   % helps to point out overfull boxes etc.
