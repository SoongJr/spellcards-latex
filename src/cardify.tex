% this takes each page of the document, sizes it down to DIN A6 and places it on a DIN A4 page
% in a way that they can be cut and folded over in a way that it all ends up sorted correctly.
% lots of rotation and reordering magic going on.

    % Because consumer-level printers are not exact (mine was off by 2mm), this requires cutting each page individually!
    % It also means that the resulting cards will not be the same size; user has to re-align all cards along the marked edges
    % and cut the excess paper on the other sides. This leaves them slightly below DIN A6 size!

    %             disable this section and just cut the whole stack at once down the middle of the physical page.
